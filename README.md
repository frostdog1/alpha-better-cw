# alpha-better coursework / Small Online e-commerce store
MERN stack is used to develop this project. The purpose is to learn about customer preferences increasingly liklihood of the user staying on the site for longer. I believe an E-commerce website is a fitting backdrop for the a/b testing to take place.

The website will follow the design of:
- user authentication by means of register and login
- selection of items that can be added to a cart but when purchasing it will be a fake checkout
- a number of settings that the user can change to their liking
- these settings will become part of the a/b testing
- a dashboard only accessible to authorised users
- dashboard contains analystics of the user preferences to find what is best
